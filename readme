fdfault is a finite difference code for solving elastodynamic rupture problems

Features:

- High order finite difference method
- Complex geometries handled through coordinate transforms on structured mesh
- Supports elastic and elastic-plastic material response
- Several friction laws, permits heterogeneous parameters in several ways
- Included Python module to simplify setting up problems and generating input files
- Analysis tools for Python and MATLAB

Requirements:

- C++ compiler with an MPI library
- Python (supports both Python 2 and 3) with numpy required for scripting problem setup
