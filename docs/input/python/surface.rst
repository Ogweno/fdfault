The ``surface`` and ``curve`` Classes
***************************************

The main classes used for handling complex geometries are the ``surface`` and ``curve`` classes. ``surface`` is used in 3D problems, while ``curve`` is used in 2D problems. The only differences in the classes are the number of dimensions; otherwise they are identical.
