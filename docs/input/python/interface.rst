The ``interface`` Class
**********************************

The ``interface`` class is the parent class of all other interfaces. It describes locked frictional interfaces, which do not require any parameter specification. Because locked interfaces are produced automatically when adjusting the number of blocks, it is unlikely that the end user will need to use this class directly.
